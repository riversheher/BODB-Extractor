def read_file(file_path: str) -> list[str]:
    """read_file expects the filepath for the BODB file,
    and returns a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a line in the file.
    
    There may be challenges in implementing this function, as there may be too many lines in the file to read at once.
    Consider using a generator to read the file line by line, and yield each line as you read it, or read the file in chunks.
    The extractor component may be used to orchestrate this behaviour. 

    Args:
        file_path (str): The absolute or relative path to the BODB file.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of strings, where each string corresponds to a line in the file.
